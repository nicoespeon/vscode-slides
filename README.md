# 👩‍🏫 VS Code Slides

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-2-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

Slides is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps you use your editor as a presentation tool.

📝 [Read the blog post](https://www.nicoespeon.com/en/2019/11/vscode-as-a-presentation-tool/)

![Demo of Slides features][slides-showcase]

This is inspired from [André Staltz's post][andre-staltz-post] where he explained how you can use VS Code **only** to give a pleasant, "live coding"-like presentation.

## Features

- ⚡ Toggle Slides mode with a shortcut
- 🎨 Apply optimized settings for presentation
- 👐 Handy shortcuts to navigate between slides

### Toggle Slides mode

Use `Ctrl Alt p` (`⌘ ⌥ p` on Mac) to toggle Slides mode.

**When you activate Slides**, a few things happen:

- Your settings got stored, so they can be reset
- Settings get replaced with others that are optimized for presentation
- All files are open in the alphabetical order, as tabs
- You can navigate between each tab with convenient shortcuts (see below)

**When you deactivate Slides**, your original settings get restored.

### Navigate between tabs (when Slides is active)

| Shortcut             | Shortcut on Mac | Operation            |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| `Ctrl Shift Alt →`   | `⌘ →`           | Go to next slide     |
| `Ctrl Shift Alt ←`   | `⌘ ←`           | Go to previous slide |
| `Ctrl Esc`           | `⌘ Esc`         | Deactivate Slides    |

You can also re-use _Toggle Slides mode_ to deactivate Slides.

> If you want to change the default shortcuts, go in VS Code **Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts** and search for `slides`. You should be able to override them.

## Pre-requisite

Slides is opinionated. By default, you'll need to install:

1. [The "GitHub Clean White" theme][recommended-theme] on VS Code
1. [The "SF Mono" font][recommended-font] on your machine

If you don't want to use these, you can configure Slides theme and font family. Open VS Code settings and search for "slides".

## Installation

1. Click on the Extensions icon (usually on the left-hand side of your editor).
1. Search for "Slides".
1. Find the extension in the list and click the install button.

## How to use best

1. Create one file per "slide"
1. Name them by number: `01.md`, `02.js`, `03.01.md`, `03.02.png`, etc.
1. Toggle Slides before you start your talk 🎤

### Tips

- Prefer to keep coding files empty, or with easy content supposed to be known.

## Release Notes

[Have a look at our CHANGELOG][changelog] to get the details of all changes between versions.

### Versioning

We follow [SemVer][semver] convention for versionning.

That means our releases use the following format:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

- Breaking changes bump `<major>` (and reset `<minor>` & `<patch>`)
- Backward compatible changes bump `<minor>` (and reset `<patch>`)
- Bug fixes bump `<patch>`
